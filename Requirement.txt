Develop an IoT solution which provide realtime traffic information to end-user (like Google Maps).
The system should be able to store the traffic status in memory and provide API to update the status in real time.
The system also should let the user to select a street from the list, then return current traffic status: High, Medium, Low.

Question:
1. Where do you want the show the result? (Functionality)
2. How the end user chooses street? (Functionality)
3. How maxium latency for each request in milisecond? (Performance)
4. How may estimated request per second? (Capability)
5. How much street do you want to manage? (Capability)
